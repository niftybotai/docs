NiftyBot is a universal data enrichment API that can find, calculate, or infer data points for any given subject. Provide some source data, ask for the information you need, and our AI will handle the rest.

This guide will walk you through authenticating, making your first request, and understanding the API's structure.

## Authentication

First, you'll need an API key. You can generate one from your NiftyBot dashboard. Once you have your key, you'll need to include it in the `X-API-Key` header of every request.

Your API key is a secret! Be sure to keep it secure and do not expose it in any client-side code.

## Making Your First Request

Let's enrich some data. The core of the NiftyBot API is the `/v1/enrich` endpoint. It takes a `source` object (the subject you want to enrich) and a `requests` array (the data you want back).

Here’s a `curl` example that asks for the number of employees at Google:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.niftybot.ai/v1/enrich \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "company": "Google",
      "website": "google.com"
    },
    "requests": [
      {
        "field_name": "employee_count",
        "field_type": "numeric"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Understanding the Request

*   `source`: This object contains the initial data you have about a subject. The more context you provide here, the more accurately NiftyBot can enrich it. It's a flexible object and can contain any key-value pairs.
*   `requests`: This is an array of objects, where each object represents a piece of information you want to find.
    *   `field_name`: The name of the data point you want. Use clear, descriptive names.
    *   `field_type`: (Optional) A hint for the expected data type.
    *   `instructions`: (Optional) Specific instructions for the AI.

### Understanding the Response

If successful, you'll receive a `200 OK` response with a JSON body containing your enrichments.

```json
{
  "requestId": "req_12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "processing_time_ms": 1850,
  "enrichments": [
    {
      "field_name": "employee_count",
      "value": "2000+",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "method": "reasoning+web",
      "reasoning": "Retrieved from recent news articles about OpenAI's growth."
    }
  ]
}
```

*   `value`: The enriched data point.
*   `confidence`: A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating the AI's confidence in the accuracy of the value.
*   `reasoning`: A brief explanation of how the value was determined.

## More Examples

NiftyBot is not limited to company data. It's a universal enrichment engine. Here are a few examples to showcase its versatility.

### Scientific Research

Enriching a research paper with its citation count.

```bash

  -d '{
    "source": {
      "paper_title": "Attention Is All You Need",
      "authors": "Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, et al.",
      "publication_year": 2017
    },
    "requests": [
      {
        "field_name": "citation_count",
        "field_type": "numeric",
        "instructions": "Find the total number of citations for this paper on Google Scholar."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Product Information

Finding the battery life of a specific product.

  -d '{
    "source": {
      "product_name": "Apple Vision Pro",
      "manufacturer": "Apple"
    },
    "requests": [
      {
        "field_name": "battery_life_video_playback_hours",
        "field_type": "numeric"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Geographic Data

  -d '{
    "source": {
      "city": "Tokyo",
      "country": "Japan"
    },
    "requests": [
      {
        "field_name": "current_population",
        "field_type": "numeric",
