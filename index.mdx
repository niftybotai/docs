---

NiftyBot is not just an API; it's an AI-powered perception engine for the world's data. It’s a universal tool capable of understanding and enriching information across any domain imaginable—from financial markets and scientific breakthroughs to product catalogs and creative works.

Think of it as a programmable layer of understanding you can apply to any subject. You provide a spark of context, and NiftyBot's AI builds a bridge to the precise data you need.

## The NiftyBot Method: An AI-First Approach

At the heart of NiftyBot is our scalable **Queue + Wait Architecture** with the `/v1/enrich` endpoint, designed for enterprise-grade performance.

1.  **AI-Powered Subject Analysis**: The process begins with our AI engine performing a deep contextual analysis of your `source` data. It doesn't just see keywords; it builds a rich understanding of the entity you're asking about.

2.  **Dynamic World Modeling**: NiftyBot's AI then autonomously determines if the requested information requires a snapshot of the live web. For data that is constantly in flux—stock prices, market sentiment, social media trends, competitor updates—it activates its **Live-Web Intelligence Engine** to consult a real-time model of the world.

3.  **Cross-Modal Data Synthesis**: The AI synthesizes information from its internal knowledge base and the live web, reasoning over the data to extract the most accurate and relevant insights. It doesn't just retrieve data; it calculates, infers, and validates it.

4.  **Scalable Processing**: Our Queue + Wait system processes requests with 90-second timeout handling. Fast requests return immediately with 200 OK, while complex processing continues in the background with graceful 202 Accepted responses.

5.  **Priority Processing**: Higher subscription tiers get faster queue priority (1-10 scale) ensuring premium users receive faster processing times.
